`HEAD` is the current commit or pointer to the commit. It changes based
on checkout.

# Intro

Git is a version controll system for your code.

# Clone

git <mark>clone</mark> â€“depth=1 just downloads the last commit and nothing else. It
means you can't go back to the previous commits and see the changes.
It's useful when you just want to download the code and don't want to
contribute to the project. It's faster than the normal clone. For
softwares which you are building just for installing and not for
development.

# Commit

Always commit atomic units. Single feature at a time.

Commit messages are really important. It makes you distinguish between a
good developer and a bad one. Let's see how to write really good commit
messages.

Fix, Rework, Add, Update, Polish. Don't use anything in past form.

Use active voice in the messages. Avoid using commit messages like
saved, posted, updated, commit early and often.

**The seven rules of good commit messages:**

- Separate the subject line from the body with a blank line.
- Keep the subject line under 50 characters long.
- Capitalize the subject line.
- Do not end the subject line with a period.
- Use imperative sentences, active voice. use present form.
- Wrap the body at 72 characters.
- Use the body for what, why and how expalanations.

Commit message verbs:

- Rework
- Add
- Update
- Fix
- Refactor
- Remove
- Optimize
- Implement
- Merge
- Revert
- Test
- Docs
- Chore
